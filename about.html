        <h2>Cooking</h2>

                Cooking not only feeds my tastebuds, it feeds my creativity and my soul. I admire food that pleases all of your senses. <br><br> My skills in the kitchen started by transforming rice-a-roni with canned chicken breast and frozen broccoli. Sometimes the rice was still crunchy but that's how I started. <br><br> I wanted to get better. I wanted my food to taste as delicious as my parents' so I started paying more attention when they cooked. Oh yes, both of my parents can cook really well. <br><br> Traveling definitely gave me a solid background in cooking from many other cultures. Some of my favorite things to make and have are enchiladas, lumpia, lasagna, etouffee, and stroganoff.

        <h2>Traveling</h2>

        <p> 
            I feel like I don't do it enough but I love to travel and I currntly do it as often as I can. If you ever get a chance to meet me you may understand that old adage, there are no strangers, only friends. I love meeting new people and learning about their cultures. <br><br> Where did my love for travel come from? I had taken several flights and lived in 4 states before I was 5 years old and I was sad when my Dad retired from the military, our great adventures stopped and grade school began. <br><br> I have been to Louisiana, Hawaii, Florida, California, Alabama, New Mexico, Nevada and Mexico. The United States has so much more for me to explore, and still I yearn for a stamp on my passport.

        <h2>Volunteering</h2>

        <p> 
            Volunteering is the way that I choose to serve my community. It's a way to show how grateful I am for the things I have been through to where I am now. <br><br> I have great parents who lead by example, volunteering their time weekly. I think it's always the most fun when we volunteer together. I have cooked for victims of Hurricane Katrina with my Dad and watched their children with my Mom. <br><br> If you're thinking of volunteering, there's all sorts of things you can do to get started. I volunteered with a few of my co-workers at the food bank. I recorded an audiobook for the Goodard School for the Blind, and I have recently signed up to join the Big Brother's Big Sister's Program.
